This is a beginner-friendly Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operation, then displays the result.

📌 Features
Takes two numeric inputs from the user

Supports four operations: +, -, *, /

Handles division by zero

Provides clean output in the format:

10.0 + 5.0 = 15.0

🛠 How to Run:

Make sure you have Python installed (python3 or above).

Save the program in a file, for example: calculator.py.

Run it using your terminal or IDE:

bash
python calculator.py

💡 Example

Enter the first number: 10  
Enter the second number: 5  
Enter the operation (+, -, *, /): *  
10.0 * 5.0 = 50.0

🚧 Notes
Input is taken as float, so it works with both whole numbers and decimals.

If the user attempts division by zero, an error message is displayed.
